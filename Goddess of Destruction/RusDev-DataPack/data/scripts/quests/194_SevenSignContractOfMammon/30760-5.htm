<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
We were able to get the text of contract with the Merchants of Mammon.<br>
But it's incomplete. The last page of the contract, containing a special clause, is missing...<br>
Long ago, the Merchants of Mammon were attacked and lost the last page.<br>
But we think we have finally located its whereabouts.<br>
It seems that the <font color="LEVEL">Priest of Dawn</font> possess the last page.<br>
That seems to implicate them in those efforts to <font color="LEVEL">locate the contract</font>.<br>
What do you think? Will you help us find the last page of the contract between Emperor Shunaiman and Mammon?<br>
