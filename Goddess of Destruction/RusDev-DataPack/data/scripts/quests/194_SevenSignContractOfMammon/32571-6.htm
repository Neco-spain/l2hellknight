<html><body>Secret Agent Colin:<br>
Now you know how difficult it is to impersonate someone and carry out a conversation while you're disguised.<br>
Your second training mission is to transform yourself into a <font color="LEVEL">young child</font> and go speak with <font color="LEVEL">Grandma Tess</font>. Bring back some proof of your conversation.<br>
Just as before, the transformation will not last long.<br>
Use the <font color="LEVEL">skill</font> that helps you move faster, such as <font color="LEVEL">running</font>, to find Grandma Tess as soon as possible.<br>
Are you ready to be transformed?<br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest 194_SevenSignContractOfMammon 32571-7.htm">Say yes.</a><br>
<font color="LEVEL">(The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buff, other than energy buffs.)</font>
