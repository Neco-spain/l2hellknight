The <font color="LEVEL">Seven Signs</font> are also often referred to as the <font color="LEVEL">Seven Seals of Shilen</font>.<br>
The Seven Signs are present in the <font color="LEVEL">Necropolises and Catacombs</font> throughout the entire continent.<br>
They are still inhabited by those who dream of revolution.<br>
Now each clan is engaged in a fierce conflict to obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Seal Stone</font>.<br>
The Seven Seals are a somewhat different situation. Can you handle the truth?<br>
