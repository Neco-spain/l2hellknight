Ah! A letter, eh? Yes, this is certainly Croop's signature.<br>
(He silently reads the letter.)<br>
Hm... I heard that Croop's cousin had disappeared. I wonder if this is related to something suscpicious that happened here recently.<br>
I will tell you all I know.<br>
This was told to me by a fellow guard.<br>
A couple of nights ago he was walking around Oren Castle when a strange shape ran past him and disappeared.<br>
Perhaps he --or it-- has something to do with Jacob's disappearance. You'd best go talk to my friend and see if he can remember any more details about the incident.<br>
