Thank you! You are indeed an adventurer with a warm heart.<br>
I won't be stingy in expressing me gratitude for all you've done. Here, take this.<br>
Please give me that necklace. I will have someone bring it to <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint in the Temple of Einhasad</font>. I will also send along a reward for all your efforts. Don't worry -- we Dwarves aren't stingy in these matters!<br>
I am sure you are tired after your long search.<br>
Refresh yourself before visiting Hollint.<br>
Then please conduct the memorial service for Jacob. Thank you!
