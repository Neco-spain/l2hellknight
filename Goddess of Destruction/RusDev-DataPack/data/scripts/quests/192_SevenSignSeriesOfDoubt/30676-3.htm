<html><body>Warehouse Chief Croop:<br>
I couldn't just sit by and twiddle my thumbs, so I started asking questions.<br>
I don't know if what I found will help you find Jacob, but clearly something strange is going on.<br>
I even heard a rumor that somebody has seen some kind of suspicious character that matches the description of the contactor killer. I asked around, and apparently <font color="LEVEL">Guard Hector</font> knows about it as well. Go see him. He is a guard at the <font color="LEVEL">north entrance of the Town of Oren</font>.<br>
Take this letter of introduction.<br>
Oh, I pray that Jacob is not in any danger!
