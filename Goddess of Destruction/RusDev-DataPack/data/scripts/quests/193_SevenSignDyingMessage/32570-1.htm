Priest Cain? Oh my! I forgot all about his order.<br>
When you get older, you know, your memory starts to go...<br>
I was so focused on finding the Tear of Fairy herb that I forgot all about it.<br>
So you're here to take the Deadman's Herb that he asked for?<br>
Here it is. Please take it to him at once with my apologies!
