<html><body>Priest Cain:<br>
You're very generous. But there is something we need before we can proceed with the service.<br>
It is called <font color="LEVEL">Deadman's Herb</font>, and it is used in the altar incense. With so many memorial services recently, I've run out of this herb.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Herb Collector Eric</font> promised to bring me more, but he hasn't arrived yet.<br>
He must have forgotten!<br>
Will you find him and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Deadman's Herb</font>? Then we can conduct the service properly.<br>
