<html><body>High Priest Hollint:<br>
Allow me to introduce the priest which is in charge of the memorial service. The services used to be perfomed in this temple, you know...<br>
Unfortunately, with all the chaos, we simply can't handle the load.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Priest Cain</font> now oversees all the memorial services.<br>
You can find him at the <font color="LEVEL">Service Altar near the lake in the town of Oren</font>.<br>
Take Jacob's necklace to him -- it has a prayer of blessing for the dead.<br>
May Einhasad reward you for your kindness!
