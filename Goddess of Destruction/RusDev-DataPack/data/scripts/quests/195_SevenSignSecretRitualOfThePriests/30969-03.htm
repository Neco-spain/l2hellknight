Oh yes, yes I can. But I'm afraid me Elmoreden
is rather out of practice, and the language was
created to confuse outsiders. Pronounce one
syllable differently and the whole sentence
chancges or loses meaning you see, and written
Elmoreden is simply a phonetic iterpretation of
the spoken language...<br>

I will need time to translate this page, my child.
In the meantime I suggest you get some rest, or
perhaps a drink or two. Haha--here's a small
reward for you.
