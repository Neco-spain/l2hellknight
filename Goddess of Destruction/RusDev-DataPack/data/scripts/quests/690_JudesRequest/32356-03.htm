Remember me, I need not every crappy weapons with conventional monsters run around the Steel Citadel. 
Naah, I need a weapon with such monsters as <font color="LEVEL"> Lesser Evils </ font> and 
<font color="LEVEL"> Greater Lesser Evils </ font>, which graze in 
<font color="LEVEL"> Anomic Foundry </ font>. Any other weapon is useless for me! Clear? <br> 
Bring me <font color="LEVEL"> 200 Evil Weapons </ font> and I'll give you the recipe <font color="LEVEL"> top S80 weapons </ font>. 
And for every <font color="LEVEL"> 5 Evil Weapons </ font> to get 3 pieces of the weapon.
