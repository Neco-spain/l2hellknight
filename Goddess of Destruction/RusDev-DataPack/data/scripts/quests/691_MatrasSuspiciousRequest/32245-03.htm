Actually, I need a blueprint of the structure of the tower of the Steel Citadel. I have learned who possesses the information I need, but he is asking for something in return. I can't get what he asks on my own. Perhaps..someone like you could go into the tower, find the monsters that drop those kind of items and bring <font color="LEVEL">744</font> of them. Please bring the <font color="LEVEL">744 Red Stones</font> to me, and I`ll reward you verry well.<br>
Oh, one last thing: be verry carefull inside there, the monsters you need to hunt are known to be verry hard to kill, so make sure you take some companions with you just to make sure you can complete this quest.<br>
