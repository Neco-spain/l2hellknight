Pantheon:
Welcome to the newly reconstructed Talking Island Village. 
It only took a few months for us to get to where we are now. 
It must be odd getting started in a town that isnt your old home. 
Fear not, you are not alone. Adventurers of all races start their 
journey here in Talking Island Village. 
If you want I can help you get familiar with your new surroundings.
