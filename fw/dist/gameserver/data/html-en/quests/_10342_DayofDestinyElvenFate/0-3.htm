Grand Magister Winonin:
<br>
You`re probably aware of the Seal of Shilen 
region located in the outskirts of Aden Castle. 
However, you might not be aware that Shilen`s 
minions are now preparing to attack this Aden 
Castle.
<br>
We found where the minions were gathering, 
and,hoping to catch them unawares, sent a 
party to attack them before they had left. As you 
probably guessed... we haven`t heard anything 
from them. We need someone... you... to find 
them.
