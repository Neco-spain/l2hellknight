Quartermaster:

We know that the soldiers died generally in the 
Cemetary area, but we haven`t managed to 
recover any of the bodies. The fighting was most 
intense around the center fountain, angel statue, 
and stone tower, so we should look there first. I 
have several people on this, so please just bring 
me 4 dog tags from the fallen.
