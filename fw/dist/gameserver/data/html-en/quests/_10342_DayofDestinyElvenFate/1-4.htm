Quartermaster:
<br>
Yes, these are our fallen comrade`s dog tags. 
Thank you. I`m sure the families will appreciate 
your hard work. Our heroes deserve to be 
remembered.
<br>
Now, I don`t think there`s much else for you to do 
here. I`m worried about captain Adolph and the 
soldiers that went ahead to the monster`s base. 
I`m sure they could use some help there.
