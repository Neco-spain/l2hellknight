Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:
<br>
I see you`ve chosen strong allies. This battle will 
be fierce, and if you see me go down, do not 
hesitate to run. We can`t afford to lose any more 
people, and if that happens, you will need time to 
regroup. Now, I hope you`re ready to take this 
fight to the enemy, because we`re going into 
their base.
