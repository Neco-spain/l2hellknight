Aden Vanguard Captain Adolph:
<br>
Phew! What a fight, eh? Now, there is a boss 
beyond that door, so let`s take a short break. We 
must call him out defeat him before we can 
leave.
<br>
I was worried, but think I will be able to bring 
out your full potential. I will lend you this 
temporarily.
