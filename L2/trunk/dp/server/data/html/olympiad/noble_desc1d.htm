Grand Olympiad points are needed to become a Hero. The person who earns the most points in each class will be the Hero of the Era. In addition, if you earn more than a certain number of Grand Olympiad points, you will be rewared with the Noblesse Gate Pass regardless of whether or not you become a Hero.<br>
