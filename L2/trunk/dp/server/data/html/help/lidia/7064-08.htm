The Darkness of Abyss<br><br>

The starlight is reflected in his smile.<br>

He speaks of courage, but I don't know where or even who I am!<br>

Can a crazy person have courage?
Who knows?<br>

His laughter rings out, and again the word, courage.
The are other words, but they're in an otherworldly language I don't understand.<br>

The Dark Mage with his dark smile speaks softly to me, holding my hand in the dark night.<br>

Courage.
Courage.
Courage.
Nothing else matters.<br>

My ceremony is still going on!
What brings you here so late?<br>
