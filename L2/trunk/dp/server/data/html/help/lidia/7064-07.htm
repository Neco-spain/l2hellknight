Everyone is dead.
I was finally able to see Nidrah, by using some terrible tricks I won't divulge here!
I just had to see him!
He was my only hope!
He agreed to see me, even though he was in the middle of a ceremony!
He reminded me what he'd said before.
He said to have courage and act!
I'm sure now that the time is right!<br>
