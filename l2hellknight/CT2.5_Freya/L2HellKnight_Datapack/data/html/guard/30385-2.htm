Recently a very interesting archeological site has been discovered whose origins are still unclear. People who have seen it say that it is divided in two, a Temple of Fire and a Temple of Water. By all accounts the place is swarming with monsters.<BR>If you are interested, you should visit <font color="LEVEL">Magister Nell</font> of the Mystics Guild. They are trying to hire someone to investigate the site for them.<BR>
