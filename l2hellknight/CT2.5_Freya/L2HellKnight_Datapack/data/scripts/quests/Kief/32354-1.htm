Monsters which were created by Beleth by the magic force dwell in Battered Lands. If to use one special item, it is possible to get magic force from the dying body of monster. It is that item. Change Chimeras on Force of Life and bring me her in this bottle. I try to begin to work money because magicians from Ivory Tower very expensive pay for it. I ask you. Let it be poor, but ask you, bring to me Dim Life Force or Life Force. Well and Contained Life Force is the best variant.<br>
