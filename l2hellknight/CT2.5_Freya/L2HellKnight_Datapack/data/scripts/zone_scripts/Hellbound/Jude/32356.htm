I heard that the Native Village lately was often exposed by the attacks. I do not know, as aborigines collected all those treasures and hid them, but that's why they hunt for Keltas. Do me the service and bring me these treasures while them fully ransacked. The reward will be adequate more than, I promise to you. Bring me 40 Native Treasures as quick as possible.<br>
