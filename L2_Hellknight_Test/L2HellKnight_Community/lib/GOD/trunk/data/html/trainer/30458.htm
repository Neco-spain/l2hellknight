!Blacksmith Poitan:

Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Blacksmith Poitan.

I have just finished renovating my workshop and am open for business. You should consider yourself lucky, I can't count how many potential clients I had to turn away while I was fixing up the place. Well now, what can I do for you?
