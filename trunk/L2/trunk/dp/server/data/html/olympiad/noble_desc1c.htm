<html><body>Grand Olympiad Manager :<br>
The Grand Olympiad's rules are as follows: The Olympiad game is divided into 2 main areas. One game is unrelated to class, and anybody can pit their skills against anyone else's. The other area, however, requires contestants to compete against those of the same class.<br>
Overwhelming victory in the Grand Olympiad games may make you a hero; crushing defeat may send you home in shame. Victory is determined by the direct damage done to other contestants. Damage inflinted on a summoner's servitor, maestro's golem or hell night's dark panther, for example, has no effect on the game's results.<br>
The winner of a Grand Olympiad game receives a portion of the loser's Olympiad points. 1/3 (1/5 in a non-class based game) of the loser's Olympiad points will be deducted and awarded to the winner. If the game is a draw, 1/5 of each contestant's points will be reduced.<br>
A substantial amount of Olympiad points will be distributed at the beginning of the competition, with only small additional sums periodically awarded. Players can participate in the Olympiad games as long as they have more than 0 points.<br>
