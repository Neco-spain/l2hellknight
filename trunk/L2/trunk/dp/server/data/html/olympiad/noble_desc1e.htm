When the Grand Olympiad games are over, the points of the Noblesse who participated are calculated. If your point total exceeds 50, you may trade your points toward Noblesse Gate Passes. Each Grand Olympiad point may be exchanged for 1,000 Noblesse Gate Passes, up to 1000 points.<br>
Anyone becoming a Hero will also receive an additional 300 Grand Olympiad points, which can be exchanged for Nobless Gate Passes.<br>
