I don't know why I'm here!
He seems to know every one of my deepest secrets!
He asked me what I wasn't willing to give up.
I was honest with him, but I can't remember what I said.
Whatever it was, I lost it!
Did that really happen?
He claims I imagined it all!
He accuses me of betraying my family, my life, my god and even natural law!<br>
