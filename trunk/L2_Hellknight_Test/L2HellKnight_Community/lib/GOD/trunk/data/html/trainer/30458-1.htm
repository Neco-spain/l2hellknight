!Blacksmith Poitan:

It is only natural that in order to create a dualsword, you'd need the two swords which arebeing combined.
Of course, I charge a small fee since I'm notworking for charity and all.
And heating costsfor stoking the fire are pretty steep... As you may know, 
it is not easy to handle the sword unless the balance between both hands is equal.
That means that only swords of identical grades can be combined...

My, an I worrying for nothing? Well, I'm sure you know all of this. 

Here, select the sword that you wish tocombine from the following list!
