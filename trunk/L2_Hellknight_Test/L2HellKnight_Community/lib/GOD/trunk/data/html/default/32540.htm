!Gatekeeper of the Abyss:

You sense an icy cold gaze fixed on you from a gigantic structure that seems somehow not quite alive nor dead. You must pass its judgement to enter the <font color="LEVEL">heart of the Seed of Infinity</font>; if you wish to avoid it, you will be expelled <font color="LEVEL">outside the Seed of Infinity</font>. However, the gaze isn't as painful as you feared. Has something happened to Ekimus?

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 1|Withstand the gaze.]

[scripts_Util:Gatekeeper -212836 209824 4288 0|Say yes.]
