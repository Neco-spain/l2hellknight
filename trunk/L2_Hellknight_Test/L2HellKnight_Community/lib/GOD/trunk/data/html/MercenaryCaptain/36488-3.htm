!Mercenary Captain:

Mobility is a basic skill of all mercenaries.
What's really needed in a large-scale battle is striders, of course.

A mercenary company receives striders when it signs a contract with a lord.
Then we assigne them to individual mercenaries.
If you need one, bring enough badges to prove your skill.

I think *60* should be enough.
