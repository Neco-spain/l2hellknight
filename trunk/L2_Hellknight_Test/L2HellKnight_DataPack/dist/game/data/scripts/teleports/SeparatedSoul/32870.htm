<html><body>Separated Soul:<br>
The Claw of Antharas barely touched my face, but my soul was still ripped apart!<br>
Now I can't gather the scattered souls in the area, but I can sense them. If you want, I can send you to where my souls are located.<br>
Also, using the <font color="LEVEL">Will of Antharas</font> that you have, I can break the <font color="LEVEL">the Sealed Blood Crystal</font>. How about it?<br>
