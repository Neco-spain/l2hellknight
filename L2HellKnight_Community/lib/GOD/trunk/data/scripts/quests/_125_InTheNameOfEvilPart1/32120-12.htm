!Balu Kaimu:

I am Balu Kaimu, a Pillar of Wisdom whose name means "eyes watching sea" in the Elrokian tongue. You used Shilen's word to awaken me!

Now you know how to communicate with me, so tell me: How is it that you came to know that word? It evoked a sacred oath between my mother Shilen and the ancient Elrokian warriors...
