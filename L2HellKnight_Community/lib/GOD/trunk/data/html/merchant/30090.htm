!Jeweler Sandra:

There are so many amazing things in this world! I've never seen them myself, but I've heard stories of blazing swords and magic shoes that allow the wearer to fly... Do you believe that these things really exist? Have you seen them? We have many amazing accessories, but nothing that fantastic, I'm afraid. Oh, I'm sorry! I'm just babbling on. How may I help you?
