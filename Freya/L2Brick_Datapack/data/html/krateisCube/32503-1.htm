If you are killed, you will be teleported back to the Match Manager after 10 seconds. If the match hasn't ended, you may re-enter. <font color="LEVEL">Doing so will not decrease your experience score.</font><br>
The 20-minute competitions start exactly on each hour and half-hour, and you can normally register up until 3 minutes before they begin. (If there was no competition in the previous time slot, you can only register between 20-27 minutes after the hour or 50-57 minutes after the hour.) Registration and admission are impossible in the 3 minutes immediately before a competition begins.<br>
