Welcome!<br>
It has come to our attention that area monsters have lately become increasingly powerful through their absorption of certain magical attributes. You have undoubtedly noticed that yourself, eh?<br>
During my travels on the continent, I discovered a special technique that may allow us to defend ourselves against that attribute-enhanced power. It is far from fool-proof, but it may be our best chance!<br>
Unfortunately, I require a variety of rare -- and expensive -- ingredients in order to manufacture the potion. My disciples are currently attempting to gather them at great risk to themselves. Perhaps you would be willing to help support their efforts?<br>
