Ah!<br>
Ambitious, eh?<br>
The Steel Citadel values a trait like that.<br>
But lefs think this through.<br>
You might get credit from the Steel Citadel for ridding them of that wretched rebel, but what would I get?<br>
Don't you think that I deserve some compensation as well?<br>
I need *10 Marks of Betrayal*.<br>
If you bring them, I will open this door for you.<br>
