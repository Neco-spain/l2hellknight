Now I will ask you another job. <br> 
Use the coupon to get weapons, get Shadow Weapons, then go to <font color="LEVEL"> the guard Christine </font>, which is located near <font color="LEVEL"> western entrance to the village </font>, help him deal with the Devils and come back. <font color="LEVEL"> Christina </font> You can find by following the <font color="LEVEL"> shooters </font>. What should I do then, I'll tell you afterwards. <br>
