Thank you! Then go find <font color="LEVEL">Herb Collector Eric</font> at once.<br>
Bring as much as <font color="LEVEL">Deadman's Herb</font> as possible.<br>
You will probably find him in the <font color="LEVEL">Enchanted Valley</font>. That place is well know for its many rare herbs.<br>
Before you go, please give me any of the deceased contractor's belongings you brought.<br>
Oh! I perceive sacred energy on them; High Priest Hollint must have already prayed over him. That makes sense!<br>
Now please hurry and bring the herb.
