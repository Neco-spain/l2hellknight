Hurry and go to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Cain</font>, who oversees the memorial services.<br>
You will find him at the <font color="LEVEL">the Service Altar near the lake in the town of Oren</font>.<br>
Don't forget to tell him that I placed the prayer of blessing in the necklace.<br>
Now go with Einhasad's blessing...
