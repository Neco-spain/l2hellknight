He is <font color="LEVEL">Guard Stan</font>, who guards the <font color="LEVEL">southern entrance to Oren Castle</font>.<br>
I should warn you that I'm not sure his story is entirely reliable.<br>
He tends to exaggerate... It's possible he saw nothing more sinister than a fox or a dog.<br>
Well, talk to him and make your own judgement.<br>
Oh, you can leave the letter of recommendation to me. He's so talkative that you won't need to worry about learning his trust.<br>
Good luck!
