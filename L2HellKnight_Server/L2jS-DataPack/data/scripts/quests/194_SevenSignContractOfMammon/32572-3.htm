What! No advice for me? Hah! Very well.<br>
I shall give her my most treasured possession, the Blue Bead.<br>
I obtained it from the bottom of the lake when I was young... Croak, croak...<br>
It has a very beatiful color, so when she sees it she'll think of me.<br>
Here, take it and deliver it to her. Then watch her reaction carefully.. Croak, croak.
