<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
Ah, you're straight-talker, just like Cain said. I like that!<br>
Unfortunately, the last page of the contract is located in a place you cannot enter right now.<br>
You will have to train rigorously for this mission.<br>
And, no, it's not a case where you can depend simply on your combat abilities.<br>
The Priest of Dawn are more cunning than you realize.<br>
No, it's more training you need!<br>
I want you to visit <font color="LEVEL">Secret Agent Colin</font>.<br>
He is the best we have for this sort of mission.<br>
Take this letter of introduction to him. He can be found at the <font color="LEVEL">South Entrance of Town of Aden</font>.
