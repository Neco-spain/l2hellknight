Ha ha! You look confused. Don't worry -- a few training missions and you'll understand what you have to do to make others believe your disguise is authentic by your actions, your odds, your mannerism.<br>
Let's begin your training. First, disguise yourself as a frog and approach the <font color="LEVEL">Frog King</font> at the nearby <font color="LEVEL">lake</font>. Ask for an item and bring it to me.<br>
Remember that the transformation is not perfect, so once you transform yourself, use the <font color="LEVEL">skill</font> that help you to move faster so you can complete the mission in the time alloted.<br>
Well, are you ready?<br>
Remember what I told you. Keep your wits about you!<br>

<font color="LEVEL">(The transformation will cancel all movement-related buffs, including the PC room buff, other than energy buffs.)</font>
