Before you can sneak into that place, you must <font color="LEVEL">transform</font> yourself using a special spell.<br>
Of course, what's really important is <font color="LEVEL">staying alert during the transformation</font>. It's not perfect, so you will have to be careful when you interact with others inside the Sanctum.<br>

In fact, you'll need to use a special <font color="LEVEL">skill</font> to move faster.<br>
